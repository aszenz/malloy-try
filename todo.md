## Definitions

### Data source

A data model that encapuslates data/views/calculations/descriptions for a simple data source

Parse the model file to extract out sources, measures, dimensions and views.

- [] Create a separate page for each source, that gives it's overview
- [] Use annotations to show descriptions for fields/views in model files
- [] Make Explorer component load views/queries via URL
- [] Link views of each source on their pages

## Questions

- How to categorize sources in the model, maybe using tags/annotations?
- Should the URL also reflect the categorical nature of sources?
